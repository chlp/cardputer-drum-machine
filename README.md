# Cardputer Meme Soundboard

Firmware for [M5 Cardputer ADV](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/Cardputer) that turns it into a portable meme soundboard with a built-in MP3 player.

## Features

### Mode 1 — Soundboard
- Press any key (a–z, 0–9) to instantly play the assigned meme sound
- The previous sound stops immediately when a new key is pressed
- A full-screen image associated with the sound is displayed
- **ESC** (`` ` `` key) stops playback and returns to idle screen

### Mode 2 — MP3 Player
- Scrollable list of all `.mp3` files from the `/mp3` folder on the SD card
- Navigate with `j`/`k` (or `,`/`;`)
- Press **ENTER** to play the selected track
- Tracks auto-advance when finished
- **ESC** stops playback

### Switching Modes
Press **TAB** to cycle: **MP3 Player** → each **soundboard panel** (subfolder of `/boards/` on the SD card, `meme` first) → back to MP3. When you switch to a panel, its folder name appears briefly (e.g. `MEME BOARD`).

## SD Card Setup

Format the SD card as FAT32, then create these folders:

### `/boards/` — Soundboard panels
Each **immediate subfolder** of `/boards/` is a separate panel (TAB cycles through them after MP3). Put the same key layout in each folder: one MP3 + one image per key (`a.mp3`, `a.jpg`, …).

The **`meme`** folder is the default / standard set (first after MP3). If a key has no file on the **current** panel, the firmware uses sound + image from **`/boards/meme/`** if present.

```
/boards/meme/a.mp3
/boards/meme/a.jpg
/boards/mykit/b.mp3   ← custom panel "mykit"
...
```

Supported image formats: **JPEG** (`.jpg`). PNG also works.
Supported audio format: **MP3** (`.mp3`).

### `/mp3/` — MP3 Player playlist
Put any MP3 files here:
```
/mp3/lofi-beat.mp3
/mp3/rickroll.mp3
...
```

## Soundboard — Default Sound Map

Without SD card, built-in synthesized sounds play instead.
